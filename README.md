To make sure this program runs as planned you need to make sure you have the correct syntax for the txt files. The program will not upload unless the syntax is correct. 
You are able to do some operations when connection to a database without the necassary tables. like search and print tables. 

##### Correct syntax for txt file:

    table_name
    column_name/column_name/column_name
    column_dataType/column_dataType/column_dataType
    dataType_length/dataType_length/dataType_length
    PRIMARY_KEY
    FOREIGN_KEYS (column/table/columnInTable)
    data/data/data
    data/data/data
    
### This program has 3 main functions 
1. Search in database
2. Print tables in database
3. Create semester plan
4. Print semester plan

The program is coded extremely dynamic. This lets you add as meny columns as you want, and the program will still run 
 
Here are the main promp for the program. This is the instructions allowed in the program. 
If the necessary tables are not present, create and semester wont be an option. The semester command will not be present until after you have initiated the create command and finished the process.
